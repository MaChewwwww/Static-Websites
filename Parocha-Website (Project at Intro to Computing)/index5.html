                        awarded the Plaque of Recognition by PUP President, Dr. Zenaida A. Olonan, together with

                        Audio-Visual Room and Computer Laboratory. In addition, an Ecumenical Chapel that can be

                        Considered as a miniature of the PUP Main Campus in its design, this “Green Campus” is a

                        as Rizal and Bulacan as a haven for their search for knowledge. And to seal its official
                        existence as an affirmation of the University’s commitment to democratize access to
                        educational opportunities for economically challenged students of society, Republic Act
                        11347, otherwise known as the “PUP Quezon City Campus Act” was signed into law on June
                        25, 2019. This was made possible by the 17th Congress House Bill No. 7734 through the
                        sponsorship of the 2nd District of Quezon City Representative, Honorable Winston
                        “Winnie” T. Castelo in the House of Representatives as well as the Chair of Committee on
                        Education, Arts and Culture, Honorable Francis “Chiz” G. Escudero from the Senate.

                        Paninirahan, Inc. (KAMPI), SUPERBLOCKS, and Kristong Hari Foundation (KHF), and
                        negotiations with local officials and other government agencies, the PUP Quezon City is
                        a pantheon of concrete success towards the struggle in people’s fight against ignorance.
                        The campus will continue its passion and commitment to “provide quality education to the
                        urban poor communities of Quezon City and its neighboring localities.”
