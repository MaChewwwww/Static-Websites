            <p>Started as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the youth at the National
                Government
                Center area from the community organizations and church groups and negotiations with local officials
                and
                other government agencies, the PUP Quezon City Campus is a pantheon of concrete success towards the
                struggle in people’s fight against ignorance. As enshrined on the Deed of Assignment on 24 March
                1997,
                that is, “to establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a
                mandate
                to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City,
                with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” Since its establishment in 1997, PUP Quezon City
                continues
                to produce quality and globally competitive graduates in the areas of education, information
                technology,
                management, marketing, entrepreneurship and office management technology. And to seal its official
                existence as an affirmation of the University’s commitment to democratize access to educational
                opportunities for economically challenged students of society, Republic Act 11347, otherwise known
                as
                the "PUP Quezon City Campus Act" was signed into law on June 25, 2019 as a renewal of the same
                passion
                and commitment to "provide quality education to the urban poor communities of Quezon City and its
                neighboring localities."</p>
