                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Started as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the youth at the National
                    Government Center area from the community organizations and church groups and negotiations with
                    local officials and other government agencies, the PUP Quezon City Campus is a pantheon of concrete
                    success towards the struggle in people’s fight against ignorance. As enshrined on the Deed of
                    Assignment on 24 March 1997, that is, “to establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National
                    Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban
                    poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” Since its
                    establishment in 1997, PUP Quezon City continues to produce quality and globally competitive
                    graduates in the areas of education, information technology, management, marketing, entrepreneurship
                    and office management technology. To seal its official existence as an affirmation of the
                    University’s commitment to democratize access to educational opportunities for economically
                    challenged students of society, Republic Act 11347, otherwise known as the "PUP Quezon City Campus
                    Act" was signed into law on June 25, 2019 as a renewal of the same passion and commitment to
                    "provide quality education to the urban poor communities of Quezon City and its neighboring
                    localities."

                <p>The PUP Quezon City Campus, formerly PUP Commonwealth Campus, is a 1.9-hectare forested land area and
